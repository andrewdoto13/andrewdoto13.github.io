Hello and welcome to my site! Thank you for taking the time to check out some of my data science work!

My name is Andy Doto and I work as a data scientist. I am also a student in the Data Science program at Indiana University-Bloomington. After starting my career in higher education, I developed a fascination with the field of data science. I've enjoyed learning about data science/analytics and how it can be applied. As I've been learning about/using machine learning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations in my work more and more, I wanted to share my ideas and projects with others, using this site as the vehicle. Thank you for taking the time to look over my posts, and please always let me know of any feedback, questions, or any ideas in general!

Take care and thank you again!
