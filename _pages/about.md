Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Andy Doto and I'm a systems and data analyst. I work in higher education and I am relatively new to the field of data science. I'm absolutely fascinated by data science/analytics and how it can be applied, so as I've been using machine learning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations in my work more and more, so I've decided to share my ideas and projects with others, using this site as the medium. Thank you for taking the time to look over my posts, and please always let me know of any feedback, questions, or any ideas in general!

Take care and thank you again!
