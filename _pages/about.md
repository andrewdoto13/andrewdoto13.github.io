Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Andy Doto and I'm a systems and data analyst, as well as a student in the Data Science program at Indiana University-Bloomington. I work in higher education and I have a fascination with the field of data science. I've enjoyed learning about data science/analytics and how it can be applied; I think it's all pretty cool. As I've been using machine learning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations in my work more and more, I've decided to share my ideas and projects with others, using this site as the medium. Thank you for taking the time to look over my posts, and please always let me know of any feedback, questions, or any ideas in general!

Take care and thank you again!
