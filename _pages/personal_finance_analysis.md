## Giving back
One of my passions is personal finance. Planning and strategy with money didn't come easy to me, but ever since I was young, I saw how finances can take its toll on individuals and families. Sadly, I am far from alone in that experience; the financial health of families across the country is and has been suffering for a while. The evidence for this is bountiful; [US household debt rising](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-household-debt-jumps-1690-trillion-2023-02-16/) and [so few Americans having an emergency fund](https://www.momentive.ai/en/blog/cnbc-financial-literacy-2023/) are just two indicators of many.

At the end of the day, if there is something I can do to help with this, why not? I've come to really enjoy helping family and friends with their personal finances, so why not offer to help others? I know it may sound strange, but I see it as way to give back to my community, and to my country by extension. After all, more stable finances leads to more stable families. More stable families leads to more stable communities, and so on. 

If you or someone you care about is struggling with personal finances, I would be happy to meet, walk through it, and be there to help however I can. I will **not** ask for any payment and I have **absolutely nothing** to sell to you. You can find my email and my Linkedin over on the left side of the page, so don't hesitate to reach out. If you are interested in learning more, continue reading the sections below about my philosophy and what I can help you with.

## Personal finances as agency and behavior
In my view, personal finance is all about behavior. I think it can be misconstrued with mathematics, investment portfolio optimization, advantageous tax strategies, etc. Are those things important? Yes of course, but you need to have a strong foundation first. That foundation is made of just simple, basic stuff. First, you get to know your finances (analysis), then you make a plan (where do you want to go and how you will get there), and then follow through (trust your plan and execute). Once you get your feet under you, then you can be off to the races. The hardest part is following through. At the end of the day, if you don't have that fire in your belly or that desire to make your life and your family's life better financially, then it will be easy to abandon your plan.

My views on personal finance are very heavily inspired by Dave Ramsey. I recommend his Baby Steps strategy whole-heartedly. You may ask, why not just send people to listen to him? Well, I'd say yes, absolutely, you should. In fact, [here's his website](https://www.ramseysolutions.com). 

Where I think I can fit in and help is simple: sometimes it can be overwhelming to start analyzing your finances and create a plan. It can be nice to have an ally or a co-pilot that can help navigate the ship, so to speak. I can be in that supportive role and be there to walk through it with you as you analyze and develop.

## What I don't do
To reiterate, I don't do this for money. I just want to do it to give back to my community and my country. I don't sell anything, either. 

While I am happy to answer questions and direct to resources, I don't really want to do investment portfolio optimization, life insurance, tax strategies, etc. I would really like to help people that are just trying to get their feet under them financially.

## What we can do together
There's a very simple process that we can go through. Here's how it can go:

* Gather Materials
    * Pull all bank transactions for past few months (as many as it takes to get a clear picture)
    * Assess inflows (income) and outflows (bills, purchases, etc)
    * Keep it organized in case we need to reference it when creating a budget
* Budget
    * Find an app or use spreadsheet (EveryDollar app is great, we use it for our family)
    * Create a zero-based budget. All that means is that you assign every dollar to a line item.
    * Budget is exact, specific, and month-based, unless there's a good reason otherwise.
    * I can share the exact budget that we use in our family if you need an example
* Analyze
    * Calculate monthly margin
    * Calculate debt-to-income ratio
    * Any other KPIs you want
    * Assess each category (does it fit with your expectations and does it fit with your past transactions?)
* Create a plan
    * There isn't one structure for this, it's highly dependent on the individual
    * Analysis can elucidate some things that will inspire a plan (I need to spend less on X, I need to make more, etc)
    * Ultimately, what do you want the next 5, 10, 20, 40 years to look like?
    * This is the fun part!

Don't hesitate reach out if you need help. I'd be happy to do whatever I can. Again, you can find my email and Linkedin on the left side of the page. Thank you and take care!
