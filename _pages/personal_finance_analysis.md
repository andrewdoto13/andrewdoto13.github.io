## Giving back
One of my passions is personal finance. Planning and strategy with money didn't come easy to me, but ever since I was young, I saw how finances can take its toll on individuals and families. Sadly, I am far from alone in that experience; the financial health of families across the country is and has been suffering for a while. The evidence for this bountiful; [US household debt is rising fast](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-household-debt-jumps-1690-trillion-2023-02-16/) and [so few Americans having an emergency fund](https://www.momentive.ai/en/blog/cnbc-financial-literacy-2023/) are just two indicators of many.

At the end of the day, if there is something I can do to help with this, why not? I've come to really enjoy helping family and friends with their personal finances, so why not offer to help others? I know it may sound strange, but I see it as way to give back to my community, and to my country by extension. After all, more stable finances leads to more stable families. More stable families leads to more stable communities, and so on. 

If you or someone you care about is struggling with personal finances, I would be happy to meet, walk through it, and be there to help however I can. I will **not** ask for any payment and I have **absolutely nothing** to sell to you. You can find my email and my Linkedin over on the left side of the page, so don't hesitate to reach out.
